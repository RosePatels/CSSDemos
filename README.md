# CSSDemos

## Overview
CSSDemos is a collection of CSS and JavaScript animations that are fun for the user to interact with. The purpose of this site is to demonstrate a knowledge of the interaction between CSS and JavaScript via animations. 

## Functionality
Each demo will have a button that a user can click on to see the code that was used to create the demo. The user can copy that code and use it in their own site.

## MVPs
* Button Background Animations - When a user hovers over a collection of four buttons:
  1. Button background changes in color from left to right
  2. Button background changes in color from right to left
  3. Button background changes in color from top to bottom
  4. Button background changes in color from bottom to top
* Flip Card Animation - When a user hovers over the card, the card flips over the y axis.
* Cursor Tile Animation - When a user hovers over a rectangular tile, the tile tilts based on the user's mouse location
* Image Animation - When a user hovers over an image:
  1. Text appears from bottom to a third of the image
  2. The whole image is blurred, lines that form a box appears, then text appears
* Text animations (Animations will repeat continously)
  1. Text animation will make each letter in a phrase appear one by one (looks like each character is being typed out)
  2. A word in a phrase will rotate out. The rotation will switch off each word.
